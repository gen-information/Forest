<p float-right>The word forest</p> <p>is derived from a Latin word“ Foris” means Outside. Forests are one of the most important natural resources of the
earth. Approximately 1/3rd of the earth’s total area is covered by forests. Forests vary a great deal in composition and density and are distinct from meadows and pastures.
