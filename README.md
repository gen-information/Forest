<p float-right>The word forest</p> <p>is derived from a Latin word“ Foris” means Outside. Forests are one of the most important natural resources of the
earth. Approximately 1/3rd of the earth’s total area is covered by forests. Forests vary a great deal in composition and density and are distinct from meadows and pastures.
Forests are important to humans and the biodiversity. For humans, they have many aesthetics, recreational, economic, historical, cultural and religious values. Forests provide 
fuelwood, timber, fodder, wildlife, habitat, industrial forest products, climate, medicinal plants etc</p><hr><br><br>
  <dt class=abc>Coniferous forests:</dt><dd class=def>Coniferous forests stretch across Canada, Alaska, Northern Asia, and Northern Europe. Their main trees are evergreen conifers which produce seeds in cones. The weather during the winter is cold, but when snow melts in the spring, some parts of the forest become swamps. There are not many different types of trees in coniferous forests because of the cold weather, and the poor soil. Fallen branches, needles, and dead animals do not decay as fast as in warmer regions. This is why the soil in coniferous forests is not very fertile. Also, only those trees that have adapted to cold weather and poor soil can survive. These trees have flexible branches that support heavy snowfalls. Less water evaporates from their leaves because of the shape of their needles.<br><br>Many coniferous trees shade large parts of the soil below them, which keeps many plants from growing on the forest ground. Some animals that live in the coniferous forests are pine martens, deer, bears, caribou, moose, lynes, heavers, and birds such as grey owls, crossbills, and marblers.
